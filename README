## Mordor
This is my course project: a website for fan fiction.

The server and client parts are written by JS.

Server - Express + PassportJS (OAuth) + Cloudinary, Client - React.

The site requires corrections and additions.

Some of the corrections are indicated in the TODO comments of the files.

I also want to do the following:

1) Translate each React component to jsx (later-to tsx).

2) Implement React-Redux.

3) Implement SSR for the main page using Next.js.

4) Translate the entire project to Typescript. 

5) Add a full-text search. 

6) Add notifications from users to the author. 

7) Add rewards for actions. 

8) Add the admin panel. 

The list will be updated.
